Suspecting the Lannisters had a hand in Bran’s fall, Catelyn covertly follows her husband to King’s Landing, where she is intercepted by Petyr Baelish, a.k.a. “Littlefinger,” a shrewd longtime ally and brothel owner. Cersei and Jaime ponder the implications of Bran’s recovery; Arya studies swordsmanship. On the road to Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys finds herself at odds with Viserys.</p>

An injured Robert takes pains to ensure an orderly transition at King’s Landing.</p>
